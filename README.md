<p>This mod connects to the Pavlok API to enable your electric shock alarm clock to be used to damage you in real life. This shock is scaled based on how much damage you take <em>but could be made to be roughly constant by setting the minimum and maximum strength very close together</em>. By default, it will use this equation to calculate shock strength:</p>
<div>
<pre>shock strength = y + ((x - 0) / 20) * (y - y)</pre>
</div>
<p>with x being the raw amount of damage you take(half heart = 1, full heart = 2, etc), y being the minimum value you set in the config, and z being the max</p>
<p>The way the Pavlok API works requires you to setup the device with the mobile app then has it recieve requests from the API and send them to the device via bluetooth, so keep your phone on hand. You will need to use the email and password that you used for your app account in the config file.</p>
<p><strong>IDK KNOW IF THIS WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER. It should, but it might end up shocking the wrong person or shocking everyone or shocking no one or killing a random person, try at your own risk</strong></p>

<h1>Disclaimer 1: I made this for fun, do not expect constant updates, mod loader ports, or version backports.</h1>
<h1>Disclaimer 2: There is only one safety feature preventing this mode from stopping your heart, which I made easily toggeable for your convience. If you disable it and end up dead;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>it's a feature</em>&trade;</span><em>. So please</em>, do NOT open a bug report.</h1>
